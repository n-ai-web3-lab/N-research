# Why This Lab Exists

## Context

N AI + Web3 Lab exists to explore how artificial intelligence systems can interact with decentralized technologies in a safe, verifiable, and human-controlled way.

Most experimentation in AI and Web3 today is either:
- Highly centralized
- Commercially driven
- Opaque or unverifiable

This lab is intentionally different.

## Core Motivation

The purpose of this lab is not to ship a product quickly, raise capital, or optimize for hype.

Instead, it exists to:
- Experiment openly
- Document ideas early
- Create verifiable research artifacts
- Separate thinking (notes) from proofs (timestamps, signatures, links)

## Research First, Product Later

All work in this repository is research-oriented:
- Notes may be incomplete or wrong
- Experiments may fail
- Conclusions may change over time

What matters is **transparent thinking** and **verifiable timelines**.

If any work here later becomes a product, protocol, or company, this repository will remain as its public research origin.

## Ownership & Attribution

This repository exists to establish:
- Clear authorship
- Clear timelines
- Clear separation between ideas and proofs

No claim of superiority is made — only a claim of *presence*.

This lab exists because someone had to start documenting this space properly.
