# N AI + Web3 Lab — Principles

These principles guide all research, experiments, and prototypes produced by this lab.

## 1. Off-Chain Intelligence
AI systems operate off-chain by default. Blockchains are not suitable for heavy computation or opaque decision-making.

## 2. On-Chain Authority
Final execution, ownership, and enforcement belong to smart contracts and users — not AI systems.

## 3. User Control
AI may suggest, analyze, or prepare actions, but users remain in control of execution.

## 4. Safety First
Research prioritizes safety, constraint design, and failure modes over speed or hype.

## 5. Verifiability
Research artifacts should be timestamped, reproducible, and publicly verifiable whenever possible.

## 6. Research Over Hype
Clarity, correctness, and learning matter more than attention.

## 7. Iterative Truth
Early ideas may be wrong. Updating beliefs based on evidence is encouraged and documented.
